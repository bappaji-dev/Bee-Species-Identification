# Bee-Species-Identification
Classification of bee species from images using SVM Machine Learning Model 


The identification of bee species, particularly honey bees (Apis) and bumble bees (bombus), is 
crucial for ecology, agriculture, and environmental studies. Traditional methods of species 
model using machine learning techniques to identify bee species from images. A support 
identification are time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to develop a classification 
using Django, allowing users to upload images and receive classification resultof their image 
Vector Machine (SVM) model was trained to classify images of honey bees and bumble bees.

The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.68 and an AUC of 0.74. The final product includes 
automating and improving the accuracy of species identification tasks.
